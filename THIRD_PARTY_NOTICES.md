# Third-Party Notices

The following files are ported from
[dsh-superagent-prototype](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/dsh-superagent-prototype)
at commit `8c32a9d` (8c32a9dc5d72c033816c6a8110b37f40cf94fba4):

- `src/core/` (all files)
- `src/policy.ts`
- `src/admission.ts`
- `src/limits.ts`
- `src/infra/text.ts`
- `tests/core-engine.spec.ts`
- `tests/stage.spec.ts`

With the exception of the `WORKER_COMMANDS` import in `src/policy.ts`, which now
points at the local `src/infra/commands.ts` shim, the ported content is
unmodified.
